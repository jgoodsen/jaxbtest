This is a test case to show how JAXB Marshalling works in a standalone unit test, but it fails when run inside a Play Application controller.

I use IntelliJ and checked in the jaxbtest.iml file for your convenience, as well as the .idea project directory.

The unit test is com.test.TestJaxbUnmarshaller - I run it inside IntelliJ.  It passes with flying colors.

To expose the JAXB Unmarshalling problem, I took the code that passes in the unit test into the Application.jaxb_parse_test method.

To see the error, startup play (play run) and then hit the url  http://localhost:9000/jaxb_parse_test

I'm not a JAXB expert or anything - this code was taken from a project I'm trying to migrate to Play.  Thanks for any help in finding this defect!
